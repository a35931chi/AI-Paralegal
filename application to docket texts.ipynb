    "LDA assumes that documents are probability distribution over laten topics.\n",
    "Topics are probability distribution over words.\n",
    "LDA takes a number of documents. It assumes that the words in each document are related. It then tries to figure out the 'recipe' for how each document could have been created. We just need to tell the model how many topics to construct and it uses that 'recipe' to generate topic and word distributions over a corpus. Based on that output, we can identify similar documents within the corpus.\n",

    "### In order to understand the LDA process, we have to know how LDA assumes topics are generated:\n",
    "1. determine the number of words in the document\n",
    "2. choose a topic mixture for the document over a fixed set of topics (ie. topic A 20%, topic B 50%, etc)\n",
    "3. generate words in the document by:\n",
    "    - pick a topic based on the document's multinomial distribution\n",
