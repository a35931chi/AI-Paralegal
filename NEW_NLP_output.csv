SCHEDULING: The next status conference will be held on March 13, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. SUMMARY: The defendant's principal, Everett Dickson, ignored the order requiring him to appear at today's conference. He must appear in person at the next conference scheduled above; failure to comply will result in a recommendation that he be adjudged in contempt of this court's lawful authority. Mr. Newton, an attorney licensed to practice in Texas, acknowledged that he contacted the plaintiff directly, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff's counsel, to negotiate a settlement with a party he knew to be represented by counsel in this matter. I will afford Mr. Newton the opportunity to submit an affidavit by March 1, 2017, explaining the circumstances of the contact and why he should not be referred to the appropriate disciplinary authorities for an apparent violation of applicable rules of professional responsibility. I denied Mr. Newton's request to seek leave on behalf of Mr. Dickson to appear by telephone at the next conference. I respectfully direct Mr. Dandeneau to provide copies of the attached minute order to Mr. Dickson and to Mr. Newton.

Plaintiff is on notice that declining to amend its pleadings to timely respond to a fully briefed argument in the Defendants' June 21, 2017 motion to dismiss may well constitute a waiver of the Plaintiff's right to use the amendment process to cure any defects that have been made apparent by the Defendants' briefing.

If Plaintiff chooses to amend, Defendants may then (a) file an answer; (b) file a new motion to dismiss; or (c) submit a letter stating that they rely on the initially-filed motion to dismiss. Nothing in this Order alters the time to amend, answer or move provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or Local Rules.

"ORDER. According to the complaint, this putative class action arises out of defendants' participation in conspiracies alleged in multi-district litigation captioned In re Currency Conversion Fee Antitrust Litigation, MDL 1409. In that action, this Court notified all counsel of relevant facts concerning a potentially disabling judicial conflict of interest. Those disclosures were set forth in a Notice to Counsel, dated 10/31/01, and docketed as docket no. 19 on 1/17/02. A copy of that Notice to Counsel is attached to this Order as Exhibit A. The parties in the MDL action were invited to consider the issue and set forth their respective views on recusal. After consultation with the parties in the MDL action and review of relevant legal authorities, this Court and relevant family members opted out of any potential class and waived any right to possible recovery related to the claims. A copy of the Notice of Docketing, dated 12/13/01 and the Opt-out, Waiver and Release of this Court and relevant family members is attached as Exhibit B. Such opt-outs, waivers and releases remove any financial interest this Court may have in the subject in controversy. The parties are directed to notify this Court by 12/22/04 whether any of them object to this Court presiding over this action (Signed by Judge William H.

"MEMORANDUM AND ORDER In the final analysis, while not perfect, this Settlement with its revamped claims process and the participation of more than 10 million individual claimants embodies Jeremy Bentham's principle of utility to do ""the greatest good for the greatest number of people."" S.E.C. v. Bear Stearns & Co., 626 F. Supp. 2d 402, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). Given the size and complexity of this multi-district litigation, it was prudent for this Court to have as much information as possible in assessing the fairness and adequacy of the Settlement. This was especially important in view of this Court's intervention to modify the notice and claims process. This Court is convinced that it was worth waiting and any delay was beneficial to the Class. For the foregoing reasons, in the exercise of its informed discretion, this Court grants final approval of the Settlement and grants in part and denies in part Class Counsel's motions for attorney's fees, reimbursement of expenses, and for incentive awards for the class representatives. The parties are directed to submit a final judgment forthwith. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge William H.

"ORDER APPROVING DISTRIBUTION OF THE AGGREGATE NET SETTLEMENT FUND. This Court having reviewed Plaintiffs' Motion to Approve the Distribution of the Aggregate Net Settlement Fund in Accordance with the March 8, 2013 Affidavit of Edward J. Radetich, Jr., C.P.A. (""Radetich Affidavit""), the Radetich Affidavit, and all supporting exhibits submitted with respect thereto, it is ORDERED that Plaintiffs' motion is GRANTED. IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED as follows: 1. The Court approves the proposed allocation of the Aggregate Net Settlement Fund in accordance with the Court-approved Allocation Plan in Ross v. American Express Co. (""AMEX"") (AMEX Dkt. No. 214) and the Court-approved CCF I Residual Allocation Plan (Ex. 1 to the April 20, 2012 Declaration of Nicholas Urban) (jointly, the ""Plans""), as set forth by the Claims Administrator (Heffler, Radetich & Saitta LLP) in the Radetich Affidavit. The Aggregate Net Settlement Fund (approximately $84,831,534.18) consists of (a) the amount remaining in the AMEX settlement fund after the Court-ordered awards to the named Plaintiffs, attorneys' fees and expenses, and notice, settlement administration and distribution expenses, and a $2.5 million reserve fund, see paragraph 3 below CAMEX Net Settlement Fund""), and (b) the Residual CCF I Settlement Fund (consisting of funds remaining in the Foreign Currency Fee Litigation Settlement Fund as of January 15, 2013, minus additional, post-fee petition, Court-approved costs, addressed in paragraph 2 below, and a $2.5 million reserve fund, addressed in paragraph 3 below). 2. The Court approves the reimbursement of $187,090.22 of post-fee petition CCF I costs to Plaintiffs' counsel. 3. The Court approves the creation of a $5 million reserve fund to cover potential reissues of checks to claimants and any CCF I checks which clear after January 15, 2013, to be allocated in the amount of $2.5 million each to the AMEX Net Settlement Fund and to the Residual CCF I Settlement Fund. 4. The Court finds that the Claims Administrator's methodology for calculating the pro-rata distributions, as set forth in the Radetich Affidavit, complies with: (a) the Plans, previously approved by the Court in its Orders dated April 30, 2012 (CCF I Dkt. Nos. 946 and 947); and (b) the requirements of due process, with all claimants having had a full and fair opportunity to present their claims and to be heard in connection with the processing and auditing thereof. 5. Accordingly, the Court authorizes payment of claims from the monies remaining in the Aggregate Net Settlement Fund for disbursement to the claimants, as set forth in the Radetich Affidavit and accompanying exhibits. 6. Plaintiffs' Lead Counsel are hereby authorized to distribute the Aggregate Net Settlement Fund in accordance with this Order and the findings, conclusions and determinations set forth in the Radetich Affidavit. 7. Without affecting the finality of the AMEX Order and Final Judgment Approving Settlement (CCF I Dkt. No. 948) or the CCF I Final Judgment and Order of Dismissal (CCF I Dkt. No. 763) or this Order in any respect, this Court reserves jurisdiction over any matters related to or ancillary to this Order. (Signed by Judge William H. Pauley, III on 4/16/2013).

"OPINION & ORDER #104191 : These actions are the latest installment in multidistrict litigation that spanned more than a decade and raised a spate of novel issues. They offer a cautionary lesson to all lawyers who labor under inexorable pressure to generate new business. When outside counsel convene meetings of competitors in the hope of propelling themselves to the forefront of an emerging trend-in this case, class-action-barring consumer arbitration agreements-they do so at their professional peril. When the first meeting convened, only two defendants had class-action-barring arbitration clauses in their card member agreements. By the time the last meeting concluded, all ten of the Issuing Banks, accounting for approximately 87% of all credit card transactions in the United States, had adopted class-action-barring arbitration clauses in their card member agreements. It was only by a slender reed that Plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the lawyers who organized these meetings had spawned a Sherman Act conspiracy among their clients. In retrospect, the Issuing Banks' short-term goal of lowering litigation costs eluded them. Undoubtedly, retaining some of the most esteemed antitrust lawyers in the nation to counter the extraordinary talents of Plaintiffs' counsel imposed a significant burden on the Issuing Banks. Only the passage of time will reveal whether the Issuing Banks' longer-term goal of avoiding the expense of class action lawsuits can be achieved. For the foregoing reasons, this Court grants judgment to the Defendants dismissing Plaintiffs' antitrust claims in this action for injunctive relief invalidating the class-action-barring arbitration clauses.

The Court awards to AMEX Lead Counsel reasonable and appropriate attorneys' fees in the amount of $47,328.50, for work on settlement administration in the AMEX case. The Court also approves the reimbursement of $993.86 of AMEX expenses. The Court authorizes payment of claims from the remaining Net Settlement Fund for disbursement to the eligible claimants, as set forth in the September 2015 Radetich Affidavit and accompanying exhibits.

"ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR SANCTIONS AND REGULATING PROCEEDINGS. Plaintiff Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc. (""Con Edison"") has moved for summary judgment on Counts Three and Four of its Second Amended Complaint. As the motion is now fully briefed, the parties shall appear before me for oral argument on February 23, 2009, at 4:00 p.m. The status conference in the above-captioned cases currently scheduled for February 6, 2009 is hereby adjourned to occur in conjunction with the oral argument on February 23, 2009. In addition, Con Edison moves to sanction the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (""Port Authority"") for relying, in its opposition papers, on various assertions in a report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and to strike these assertions or Port Authority's opposition papers in full. Alternatively, Con Edison asks for leave to file an additional submission to respond to Port Authority's use of the NIST Report. The motion to strike and for sanctions is denied, in both of its parts. A case for sanctions has not been made. If the Court finds the assertions from the NIST Report worthy of consideration, Con Edison may ask for an opportunity to comment. In its papers, Port Authority comments that Con Edison filed its motion for partial summary judgment before discovery was completed. I wish to know what additional discovery is expected or planned that the parties reasonably anticipate will elicit admissible evidence to clarify their contemporaneous understandings of the meaning of the relevant clauses of the lease agreement. Both parties' submissions on this question will be due on February 13, 2009, at 12:00 p.m. The Clerk shall mark the motion to strike and for sanctions (Doc. #152) as terminated.

"ORDER granting 43 Letter Motion for Extension of Time. Defendants have indicated that rather than renew their motion to dismiss as against plaintiff's proposed amended complaint (or modify it as a result of the proposed amended complaint), they wish instead to oppose plaintiff's motion to amend her complaint. They do not propose any time frame by which to file their opposition. Accordingly, the Court will give the Defendants until May 12 to file any opposition to the motion. Defendants should be mindful that, in this Circuit, a pro se complaint should not be dismissed without the Court granting leave to amend at least once when a liberal reading of the complaint gives any indication that a valid claim might be stated. Dolan v. Connolly, 794 F.3d 290, 295 (2d Cir. 2015) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). Moreover, Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure mandates that leave to amend should be freely give[n]... when justice so requires. [T]his mandate is to be heeded. Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). Here, this would be Plaintiff's first amendment of her pleading. Accordingly, Defendants should make clear in their opposition why they are taking the position that the motion to amend should not be granted, rather than agreeing to the filing of an amended complaint without prejudice to a renewed motion to dismiss if Defendants believe the amended complaint is deficient (or alternatively filing an answer to the amended complaint). Defendants are directed to provide a copy of this text-only order to the pro se Plaintiff forthwith. (HEREBY ORDERED by Magistrate Judge James L. Cott)(Text Only Order) Copies of Notice of Electronic Filing To Be Mailed By Clerks Office.

"OPINION AND ORDER #86305, I find that AW unlawfully converted Phansalkar's 385,902 MCEL Shares. I further find that Phansalkar's failure to disclose certain directors' compensation and Board seat opportunities breached his duty of loyalty and good faith to AW. However, I have determined that these isolated misdeeds did not constitute a scheme of defraud AW or so taint his employment relationship as to warrant forfeiture of his MCEL Shares. Accordingly, (1) AW's claim that Phansalkar's acts of disloyalty requir him to forfeit his MCEL Shares is Denied. (2) it is Ordered that Phansalkar recover: (a) judgment in his favor against AW in the amount of $4,417,655.40; (b) interest on $2,945,700.00, at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum from 5/4/01 to the date of judgment; and (c) interest on $1,471,995.40, at the rate of nine percent (9%) per annum from 5/21/01 to the date of judgment; to be calculated by the Clerk of the Court, as allowed by law. (3) It is further Ordered that AW recover judgment in its favor against Phansalkar for an amount, to be determined at a later date, representing the compensation Phansalkar earned on the specific transactions where he was disloyal .

"DISCOVERY ORDER: As to the first group of requests, counsel have engaged in a vigorous debate, by letter, concerning the degree to which the events of default under different ISDA forms are the same or similar. For present purposes, I will assume that these events of default are identical. Notwithstanding that assumption, however, Brookfield is correct that the business decisions it may have made with respect to other counter parties is of marginal, if any, relevance to the issues in this case. Moreover, the burden that would be imposed by responding to the requests is clearly disproportionate to any limited light that the discovery materials might shed on those issues. The request is therefore denied. Turning to the second group of requests, AIG seeks to establish that certain actions that it took with respect to collateral calls and foreign exchange transactions shortly before the Government bailout were consistent with industry practice, rather than having been occasioned solely by its own dire financial straits,. In an effort to do so, it has requested materials concerning Brookfield's dealings with other parties for a period of many months. This request is overbroad. Brookfield will, however, be required to produce any materials responsive to these requests -but only for the period from September 10 through 17, 2008, and an additional agreed one-week period earlier in time: If the parties cannot reach agreement on a suitable one-week period, the Court will make that selection for them.

As I observed during the conference, both sides' arguments have some merit. Recognizing that, I will strike the Solomonic balance that I previously suggested,by requiring AIG to produce the transcript of any deponent in this case who previously was deposed in the class action at least one business day before the deposition is scheduled to occur. If AIG has claimed confidentiality in the SEC action with respect to any of the transcripts or portions thereof, Brookfield shall ensure that the testimony is accorded the same level of confidentiality in this case. Also, because document discovery in this case has been extensive, AIG need not produce the deposition exhibits, with the exception of any resumes or curriculum vitae of the deposition witnesses that have not previously been produced.
