SCHEDULING: The next status conference will be held on March 13, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. SUMMARY: The defendant's principal, Everett Dickson, ignored the order requiring him to appear at today's conference. He must appear in person at the next conference scheduled above; failure to comply will result in a recommendation that he be adjudged in contempt of this court's lawful authority. Mr. Newton, an attorney licensed to practice in Texas, acknowledged that he contacted the plaintiff directly, without the knowledge or consent of the plaintiff's counsel, to negotiate a settlement with a party he knew to be represented by counsel in this matter. I will afford Mr. Newton the opportunity to submit an affidavit by March 1, 2017, explaining the circumstances of the contact and why he should not be referred to the appropriate disciplinary authorities for an apparent violation of applicable rules of professional responsibility. I denied Mr. Newton's request to seek leave on behalf of Mr. Dickson to appear by telephone at the next conference. I respectfully direct Mr. Dandeneau to provide copies of the attached minute order to Mr. Dickson and to Mr. Newton.

Accordingly, the Court vacates the certificate of default entered in this case. Additionally, the Court cancels the default judgment hearing scheduled for August 16, 2017 and vacates all deadlines associated with that hearing.

Plaintiff is on notice that declining to amend its pleadings to timely respond to a fully briefed argument in the Defendants' June 21, 2017 motion to dismiss may well constitute a waiver of the Plaintiff's right to use the amendment process to cure any defects that have been made apparent by the Defendants' briefing.

Wells Fargo Sec., LLC., 797 F.3d 160 (2d Cir. 2015) (leaving ""unaltered the grounds on which denial of leave to amend has long been held proper, such as undue delay, bad faith, dilatory motive, and futility""). If Plaintiff chooses to amend, Defendants may then (a) file an answer; (b) file a new motion to dismiss; or (c) submit a letter stating that they rely on the initially-filed motion to dismiss. Nothing in this Order alters the time to amend, answer or move provided by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or Local Rules.
