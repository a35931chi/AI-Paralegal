"ORDER denying 57 Letter Motion for Adjournment of Settlement Conference. The request to cancel the settlement conference scheduled for October 9 is respectfully denied. The Court believes that the parties should make their best efforts to settle this case at this juncture, before deposition discovery proceeds. The Court is mindful of plaintiff's concern that Ms. Kuczkir's participation from South Carolina may make things more difficult, and, to that end, the Court is working with her counsel to see if it is feasible for Ms. Kuczkir to participate via a video teleconference. In any event, the parties and their counsel are reminded of two important principles in anticipation of the settlement conference. First, as noted in my Standing Order for Settlement, ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it."" (from Harper Lee's ""To Kill A Mockingbird"") The parties and their counsel should make all efforts to see the case through the other side's eyes as they prepare for the conference. Second, as President Lincoln once exhorted: ""Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise whenever you can. Point out to them how the nominal winner is often a real loser - in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a peacemaker, the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man. There will be business enough."" Counsel are directed to share this order, and the quotes cited herein, with their clients in advance of the conference and further directed to come to the conference with an open mind.

The parties agree to vacate the current Discovery Scheduling Order in the First Action, and agree that they will submit a new joint Discovery Plan for the Consolidated Actions within thirty (30) days of when this stipulation is so-ordered. 9. This Stipulation is without prejudice to any other rights that any party may have. 10. This Stipulation may be executed in counterparts and electronic or facsimile signatures shall be treated as originals. This Stipulation may, when fully executed, be filed via ECF by any of the parties. (Signed by Judge John G. Koeltl on 1/28/2015) Filed In Associated Cases: 1:14-cv-00130-JGK, 1:14-cv-09060-JGK.

Engelmayer, J.) granting the application of plaintiffappellee Benihana, Inc. for a preliminary injunction in aid of arbitration of a dispute arising under the parties license agreement. The district court enjoined Benihana of Tokyo from: (1) selling unauthorized food items at the restaurant it operates pursuant to the license agreement; (2) using certain trademarks in connection with the restaurant in a manner not approved by the license agreement; and (3) arguing to the arbitral panel, if it rules that Benihana of Tokyo breached the license agreement, that Benihana of Tokyo should be given additional time to cure any defaults. We conclude that the district court was within its discretion in granting the first and second components of the injunction.

Rather, the Court intends to resolve the pending, fully briefed motion based on the existing record, rather than complicating and delaying resolution of that matter by effectively expanding the record. This ruling is without prejudice to Bi's right to pursue appropriate relief for the new violations it alleges. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Paul A.

"ORDER denying 33 Motion for Sanctions. For that reason, BI's motion for sanctions for violations of the Preliminary Injunction is denied. Because the Court denies that motion, the Court denies BI's request for attorneys' fees incurred in litigating this motion as well. At the same time, the Court denies BOT's request for attorneys' fees in defending against BI's motion. That is because BI's bid for coercive sanctions, although resolved at a time when such sanctions were no longer viable, had a colorable, if not a compelling, basis at the time it was made. Notwithstanding its denial of BI's motion for sanctions for violations of the Preliminary Injunction as moot, the Court observes the following. In pertinent respects, the substance of the Preliminary Injunction has been recapitulated in the Permanent Injunction in 15 Civ. 7428 that took effect today when the Court adopted the arbitral panel's Award. And the parties have each recognized the Court's authority to enforce the Permanent Injunction, including by, if necessary, imposing coercive sanctions. See BI Supp. Br. 3-5; BOT Supp. Br. 2-7. The Court is hopeful that the parties will use this moment as a pivot, and attempt in good faith to repair their working relationship and amicably resolve the issues that have divided them. The disputes between BI and BOT have consumed far too much money, time, ink, and acrimony. Pending any renegotiation, however, the License Agreement governs the parties' relationship as it relates to the Benihana restaurant in Honolulu. In the event of a future motion to enforce the Court's Permanent Injunction-including based on BOT's use of advertisements, publicity, and signs that have not been approved by BI in accordance with Article 5.2 of the agreement-the Court's intention would be to resolve any such dispute with firmness and dispatch. Lest the point be unclear: The Court expects each party to punctiliously abide by the provisions of the agreement incorporated in the Permanent Injunction. The Clerk of Court is directed to close the motion pending at docket number 33 and to close this case. (As further set forth in this Order) (Signed by Judge Paul A.

"ORDER terminating 124 Motion for Leave to Present Ajay Gupta's Direct Testimony Live at Trial. The Court has reviewed the letter from SDG Corporation, Dkt. 124, seeking leave at the upcoming bench trial to present the direct testimony of its witness Ajay Gupta in live form rather than by affidavit, and the letter in opposition by Laurus Capital Management, LCC, Dkt. 125. The Court directs that Mr. Gupta's direct testimony, like that of all other party witnesses, be presented by means of an affidavit. In light of SDG's stated concerns, the Court encourages SDG to assure that Mr. Gupta's affidavit be as comprehensive as possible. To the extent that SDG anticipates arguments by opposing counsel as to why Mr. Gupta's testimony as to particular facts may not be credible, SDG is encouraged to anticipate such arguments in preparing Mr. Gupta's affidavit. Given the potential significance of Mr. Gupta's testimony, the Court fully expects that Laurus will cross-examine him at trial, following which SDG will be at liberty to conduct a live re-direct examination of Mr. Gupta. For avoidance of doubt, to the extent that Laurus intends to submit deposition testimony of Mr. Gupta, such prior testimony is to be offered in the course of the cross-examination of Mr. Gupta, so that SDG has the opportunity, during re-direct examination, to examine Mr. Gupta about such prior statements (e.g., to develop relevant context for them). The Court is confident that, with the benefit of detailed direct testimony in affidavit form from Mr. Gupta and live cross and re-direct examination, it will be well-positioned to assess his credibility.

"ORDER: At yesterday's conference, the Court read aloud its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a verdict in this case, in which a bench trial was held between April 24 and 27, 2017. Consequently, the Court orders the following relief: First, the Court grants declaratory relief to SDG on its claims pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C.  2201 and 2202. Specifically, the Court holds that (1) Erato's lien against SDG's assets, recorded by the Connecticut Secretary of State at file no. 2627336, has been validly and finally terminated and cannot be revived or executed upon, (2) the Master Security Agreement and the Guarantee and the Security Agreement signed by Mascon's Sandy Chandra in March 2008 are invalid, void, of no force or effect, and unenforceable, and (3) neither Erato and/or Laurus, nor any of their successors, assigns and affiliates, has a valid security interest, lien, or claim against SDG Corporation or any of its property or assets. Second, as to defendants' counterclaims, the Court finds SDG not liable for breach of the MSA and Guarantee. These documents were not valid or binding on SDG. Third, as to SDG's claim for tortious interference with business relations, the Court holds that defendants not liable. The Court finds that SDG failed to show the requisite bad faith or fraudulent conduct on defendants' part in imposing the lien on SDG. Because the Court has been advised by the parties that post-trial motions may be made, the Court directs the Clerk of Court not to enter judgment at this time, and to wait for further instruction from the Court before doing so.

"ORDER: At an in-court conference earlier today, October 23, 2008, in the Derivative Action, 07 Civ. 9696, the Court indicated its intention to resolve all motions to dismiss in all three Actions (i.e., the Securities Action, the Derivative Action, and the ERISA Action) by no later than February 17, 2009, and then to have all parties embark on consolidated discovery in all three Actions, with such discovery to be completed no later than October 20, 2009, with a likely trial date of sometime in February, 2010. (Certain limited discovery in some of the Actions, related to injunctive relief or other special purposes, may possibly occur prior to February 17, 2009, a matter on which the Court will shortly be receiving papers from the parties.) If any counsel in either the Securities Action, 07 Civ. 9633, or the ERISA Action, 07 Civ. 10268, objects to any of the above-underscored dates, such counsel should convene a conference call with the Court and other affected parties by no later than Thursday, October 30, 2008 and the Court will consider such objections and issue a further order if necessary. Independently, counsel in the ERISA case should arrange to call the Court by no later than Monday, October 27, 2008 to discuss motions to dismiss related to that Action. The previous referral of these Actions to Magistrate Judge Eaton for all pre-trial purposes is hereby modified and clarified as follows: All discovery matters will remain referred to Magistrate Judge Eaton, including any motions or applications related solely to discovery. The Magistrate Judge, however, will not have the authority to extend the October 20, 2009 date, now set for completion of all discovery. All other motions or applications of any kind whatever must first be brought to the undersigned's attention through a joint conference call with the Court and affected parties, at which time the Court will determine whether the motion or application is best resolved by this Court or should be referred to the Magistrate Judge.

"OPINION AND ORDER. Accordingly, the Court concludes that demand in the Derivative Action was not excused, and that the BofA Board did not wrongfully refuse Lambrecht's demands. Having concluded that both actions fail on these threshold issues, it follows that both complaints must be dismissed in their entirety. The Court therefore grants the motions to dismiss submitted in both actions, and instructs the Clerk of the Court to enter final judgment in both the Derivative Action, 07 Civ. 9696, and Lambrecht v. O'Neal, 09 Civ. 8259, dismissing the complaints with prejudice. (Signed by Judge Jed S.
