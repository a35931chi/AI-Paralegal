in retrospect the issuing banks ' short term goal of lower litigation cost elude
undoubtedly retain some of the most esteemed antitrust lawyer in the nation to counter the extraordinary talent of plaintiffs_' counsel impose a significant burden on the issuing banks
only the passage of time will reveal whether the issuing bank ' long term goal of avoid the expense of class_action lawsuit can be achieve
for the foregoing_reason this_court grant judgment to the defendants dismiss plaintiffs_' antitrust claim in this_action for injunctive_relief invalidate the class_action_bar arbitration_clause
