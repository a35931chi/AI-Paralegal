these_action be the late installment in multidistrict litigation that span more_than a decade and raise a spate of novel issue
offer a cautionary lesson to all lawyer who labor under inexorable pressure to generate new business
when outside counsel convene meeting of competitor in the hope of propel to the forefront of an emerge trend in this case class_action bar consumer arbitration agreement do_so at professional peril
when the first meeting convene only defendant have class_action bar arbitration_claus in card member agreement
by the time the last meeting conclude all of the issuing banks account for approximately % of all credit card transaction in the united_states have adopt class_action bar arbitration_claus in card member agreement
be only by a slender reed that plaintiffs fail to demonstrate that the lawyer who organize these meeting have spawn a sherman act conspiracy among client
in retrospect the issuing banks ' short term goal of lower litigation cost elude
undoubtedly retain some of the most esteemed antitrust lawyer in the nation to counter the extraordinary talent of plaintiffs_' counsel impose a significant burden on the issuing banks
only the passage of time will reveal whether the issuing bank ' long term goal of avoid the expense of class_action lawsuit can be achieve
for the foregoing_reason this court grant judgment to the defendants dismiss plaintiffs_' antitrust claim in this_action for injunctive_relief invalidate the class_action bar arbitration_clause
